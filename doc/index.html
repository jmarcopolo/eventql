<h1>EventQL v0.3.0</h1>

EventQL is a distributed, analytical database. It allows you to store massive amounts
of structured data and explore it using SQL and other programmatic query facilities.

<b>If you don't like reading documentation, start with the <a href="./getting-started/first-steps/">First Steps</a> page.</b> It
will walk you through starting a server, inserting events and running a query
in 10 minutes. For more in-depth information please refer to the remaining chapters.

<p class="warning">
Beta Release: This is a beta release of EventQL. It's generally stable, but
still expect some bugs and vulnerabilities. Please don't use it for anything
mission critical just yet. We expect to remove this warning with EventQL v0.6.0.
